## Resume
The study of ancient manuscripts constitutes a fascinating field of research, offering valuable insights into humanity's intellectual past. Despite significant advancements in handwritten text recognition, the analysis of historical manuscripts remains a complex challenge. Our project aims to detect and segment mathematical expressions contained within the manuscripts of Leibniz. Conducted within the IPI team at LS2N, in synergy with the SPHERE Paris Diderot laboratory, our project unfolds in two distinct and complementary phases. The first phase of literature review allowed us to identify the current state of knowledge and pinpoint gaps in our field. The second phase focuses on the design and implementation of a solution based on a deep convolutional neural network specifically tailored for the fine detection and segmentation of mathematical expressions in Leibniz's texts. Faced with limitations in terms of original data volume, we also opted for data augmentation strategies, thus generating sets of artificial images to enrich our database. The adopted methodology enabled the training of our model on a set of 300 generated images, resulting in an evaluation on a separate corpus reflecting an average precision of 60%. This research underscores the complexity of analyzing ancient documents, particularly for mathematical expressions, adding a crucial level of difficulty to advancing the study of historical manuscripts.

## Acknowledgements
First and foremost, we would like to express our gratitude to our supervisors, Harold MOUCHÈRE and Yejing XIE, for their continuous support and guidance throughout the project, as well as for proposing this deeply engaging topic. We also extend our thanks to our coordinator Philippe LERAY. Additionally, we would like to acknowledge the teams at the SPHERE Paris Diderot laboratory, particularly David RABOUIN, who leads the project on the editing and commentary of Leibniz's unpublished mathematical manuscripts, as well as the Leibniz Archiv in Hanover for their contribution and for providing us with images of Leibniz's manuscripts. Lastly, we thank all individuals who contributed directly or indirectly to the project.
